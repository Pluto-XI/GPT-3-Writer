# GPT-3 Writer
This is a project to learn more about machine learning/AI models and how to work with them. This is a project I've been looking forward to for a while and I'm super excited to have finally started working on it. 

<b>This project is using the GPT-3 AI model and an OpenAI api.</b>

GPT-3 is an AI model that is super good at writing what we want. It was trained using a massive portions of the internet. It can give us start-up ideas, movie scripts, etc. The possibilities are endless.

This project has a web front-end and interacts with the OpenAI api in order to utilize the GPT-3 model. I'm also building a browser extension that can inject text into a webpage that the user is on.
